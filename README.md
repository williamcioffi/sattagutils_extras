# sattagutils_extras
Some extras for the [sattagutils](https://github.com/williamcioffi/sattagutils) R package. In particular, features that require heavy dependencies.

## What's inside
Well nothing right now, but soon I'll add:

1. Position estimates (bsam? crawl? others?)
2. Plotting positions including with leaflet
3. Some automated report generation
